# Human Centered Design Techniques

## Participatory Design

The Concept Plus team held a workshop with two users and worked together to design the initial FDA-GO prototype.  During the workshop the team presented initial design ideas to users during a whiteboard session and users were asked for feedback and recommendations.   Throughout the workshop the design was refined and initial designs were accepted by both users and the team.

## Interviews

Interviews were conducted with users at least two times throughout the life of the project.  Users were interviewed individually by the interaction designer and were asked to answer specific questions the team had put together.  Feedback from interviews were captured through reports and used to enhance user experience.

## Iterative User Interface Design

The user interface design was developed through an iterative approach.  The initial design was developed during the participatory design workshop. Paper wireframes were then created and users were asked to complete a series of tasks and provide feedback as well as accessing an interactive clickable prototype.  The wireframes and clickable prototypes were updated based on feedback captured and users were put through another round of interviews to refine the design even further.

# Design Style Guide

To establish and retain the branding for the FDA-GO a design style guide was created to ensure that branding assets and guidelines are followed. See the [FDA-GO Design Style Guide ](http://fdago-styleguide.conceptplusllc.net/) for complete details.

# Agile Aproach

_See our [Attachment E: Approach Criteria Evidence](./prototype/appROACH_CRITERIA_EVIDENCE.md)_

# Technologies

Keeping in mind the short timeframe, we still wanted to create a prototype that worked on multiple devices while satisfying all of the criterias for this challenge. The FDA-GO application will consume the [OpenFDA APIs](http://open.fda.gov). This was achieved with using many modern and open source technologies.

## Modern, Open Source Technologies

* **[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)** - Cross-platform runtime environment
* **[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)** - Front-end framework
* **[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)** - Front-end UI framework
* **[GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/)** - Javascript task runner
* **[Jasny Bootstrap](http://www.jasny.net/bootstrap/)** - Enhanced Bootstrap utilities
* **[GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com)** - Javascript task runner
* **[Datatables.net](http://www.datatables.net)** - Advanced jQuery tables
